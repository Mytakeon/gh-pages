I find the process of writing immensely helpful to organize and crystalize thoughts, insights and learnings. I have been writing in a journal the past 3 years, and it has proved to be very therapeutic.
I decided to start writing in this blog, not really to share insights or programming knowledge (though I'll be happy if it helps someone!), but for 3 main reasons:

# Writing...

I know that writing will keep me little more honest: if an idea sounds good in my head, chances are, it's really rubbish. If I feel like I am understanding something, chances are, my understanding is limited; I just didn't realize it yet:

_Writing this - currently at the 3rd colum_

Another good way to realize how fallible your understanding or idea is, is to try to teach it to somebody who doesn't know anything about it. A good teacher will understand the topic in depth and will know how to simplify concepts and use analogies, as opposed to regurgitating the de-facto explanations that require some form of prior knowledge.

Writing is not just about memorizing and formulating a thought, it can also help you take a line of reasoning further, since you your chain of thoughts is directly under your eyes:

This is obviously an over-simplification of how we come to understand concepts or have new ideas - but doing so _does_ require joining thoughts together, which can't happen if the thought is not available in memory.

Another reason writing is crucial to developing ideas is just **time**: How far and how well the domain around an idea is explored depends on the duration you spend thinking of that idea, and in that sense, writing can be seen as an accompanying activity that supports longer sessions of thinking.

# ...in public

Writing online requires some commitment on the quality of the content you publish. By yourself, you can be imprecise, leave things unfinished - but you would think about it twice before doing that and putting it on the web, for everyone to see.
Publishing your writing is a way to make sure that you'll put at least _some_ time in the process of refining your writing, to review it enough times so that you're not thinking that it makes you a look like a fool. It's forcing yourself to be accountable for your content.

This post for example, might not be much - it might be flawed, but it is my own synthesis I can stand by, something I am comfortable being associated with. It would have looked very different if it only existed in my personal notes.

# Producing something

A blog post is a finite creative output that has a deadline and needs to be uploaded. Personally, I find this self-imposed constraint to be immensely helpful to escape my usual spiral of lurking the web; _kind of_ learning about a tool, _kind of_ starting a side project, without actually finishing anything. Making and finishing something is great! It'll make you feel accomplished, you'll remember it, and you can even show it to others (if you're not afraid of [looking stupid](https://danluu.com/look-stupid/)).
