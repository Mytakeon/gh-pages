I find the process of writing immensely helpful to organize and crystalize thoughts, insights and learnings. I have been writing in a journal the past 3 years, and it has proved to be very therapeutic.
I decided to start writing in this blog, not really to share insights or programming knowledge (though I'll be happy if it helps someone!), but for 3 main reasons:

# Writing...

I know that writing will keep me little more honest: if an idea sounds good in my head, chances are, it's really rubbish. If I feel like I am understanding something, chances are, my understanding is limited:

_Writing this - currently at the 3rd colum_

Another good way to realize how fallible your understanding or idea is, is to try to teach it to somebody else. A good teacher will understand the topic in depth and will know how to simplify concepts, use analogies; as opposed to regurgitating the de-facto definition that requires some form of prior knowledge.

Writing is not just about memorizing and formulating a thought, it can also help you think further, since you your chain of thoughts is directly under your eyes:

<img class="py-3 " alt="Thinking in your head vs. on paper" src="/chain-of-thoughts.svg"/>

This sounds like an over-simplification - but building an idea or understanding does require joining thoughts together, which can't happen if the thought is not available (or in memory).

A last reason - though perhaps less romantic than the previous two - is just **time**. How far and how well the domain around an idea is explored depends on the duration you spend thinking of that idea, and in that sense, writing could just be accompanying a longer session of thinking.

# ...in public

Writing online requires some commitment on clarifying your ideas. By yourself, you can be imprecise, leave things unfinished - but you would think about it twice before doing that and putting it on the web, for everyone to see.
Writing in public enforces that you'll put at least _some_ time in the process, which is a big win.

# Producing something

Writing a few sentences in a personal notebook doesn't feel like much. Putting a new blog post that I iterated 3 times on, that's something! It's something original that took me time to formulate. It might not be much - it might be (very) flawed, but it is a synthesis I can stand by, something I am comfortable being associated with.

Finally, a blog post is finite. It's a creative output that has a deadline and needs to be uploaded. Personally, I find this self-imposed constraint to be immensely helpful to escape my usual spiral of lurking the web; _kind of_ learning about a tool, _kind of_ starting a side project, without actually finishing anything. Making and finishing something is great! It'll make you feel accomplished, you'll remember it, and you can even show it to others (if you're not afraid of [looking stupid](https://danluu.com/look-stupid/)).
